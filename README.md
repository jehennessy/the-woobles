Jordan Hennessy's Sr. Shopify Engineer Exercise for The Woobles READ ME

## Build/Usage Instructions

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to view the exercise.


## Things I've Tested
- Only one Featured Wooble is displayed
- Keyboard accessibility 
- Responsiveness 


## Next Steps
- Add Shopify Cart Ajax API to add to cart button so it works
- Add alt text to the images that are missing it
- Add a check for out of stock products
    - Change add to cart text to "Out of Stock"
    - Disable add to cart button
- Add badges to cards - looks like the tags aren't used for this so would probably add with a metafield.
